Anticipating the Y2K bug and the introduction of the unified European currency (Euro), Tata Consultancy Services developed a factory model for Y2K conversion. The company also created software tools to automate the conversion process and facilitate implementation by third-party developers and clients.[16] In late 1999, TCS introduced Decision Support System (DSS) solutions to the domestic market.[17] In 1999, the company also registered its first tagline, "Beyond the Obvious."[18][19]
