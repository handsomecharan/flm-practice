This October, we accelerated our work to bring major AI breakthroughs and research into tools that can improve the reality of people's everyday lives. That included using AI to make technology easier and more natural by rolling out Gemini for Home and a vibe coding experience in AI Studio, making it simpler to build AI apps. We also launched new anti-scam and AI security features for Cybersecurity Awareness Month to protect people from digital threats. And we continue to apply advanced AI to tackle huge global challenges, using it to discover a new pathway for cancer therapy and speed up the development of clean fusion energy. Ultimately, it's all about putting AI to work to make life better, safer and more productive for everyone.
